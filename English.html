        <p>Welcome to my HTML page !</p>
        <p>My name is Maria Elenidou. I hold a Bachelor's degree in English Language and Linguistics from the University of Sheffield and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Multilingual Communication Technology at the University of Geneva. I have previously worked as a volunteer translator and English teacher, and am currently doing my translation internship and  I am volunteer content creator for an organisation. Having Greek as my mother tongue, speaking French and English fluently, German at a professional level and Russian at an intermediate level, I had the opportunity to expose myself to different cultures. I am mainly interested in technology, multilingual communication and localisation. On my website you can find my favourite Greek islands and a brief description. My website is available in English, French, German, Greek and Russian.</p>
        <h2>My favorite greek islands !</h2>
        <h3>Santorini</h3>
        <img class="class-img-top" src="santorini.jpg" alt="santorini" width="50%" height="50%">
        <p>Santorini (or Thíra), the precious gem of the Aegean, is actually a group of islands consisting of Thíra, Thirassiá, Asproníssi, Palea and Nea Kaméni. Did you know that the whole complex of Santorini islands is still an active volcano (the same as Méthana, Mílos and Nísiros) and probably the only volcano in the world whose crater is in the sea? The islands that form Santorini came into existence as a result of intensive volcanic activity.</p>
        <h3>Mykonos</h3>
        <img class="class-img-top" src="mykonos.jpg" alt="mykonos" width="50%" height="50%">
        <p>Welcome to Greece's most famous cosmopolitan island, a paradise in the heart of the Cyclades. According to mythology, Mykonos was formed from the petrified bodies of giants killed by Hercules. In contrast to other Cycladic capitals, the capital town (Hóra) of the island is not built in the shape of an amphitheatre but instead spreads out over a wide area. It is one of the best examples of Cycladic architecture and a spellbinding attraction for visitors.</p>
        <h3>Lefkada</h3>
        <img class="class-img-top" src="lefkada.jpg" alt="lefkada" width="50%" height="50%">
        <p>Lefkada is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea, connected to the mainland by a causeway. Dozens of beaches of unsurpassed beauty crown the coastline of Lefkada. Among them the champion Porto Katsiki, gorgeous Egremnoi, Gialos, Kathisma, peaceful Myloi, Agios Giannis on the west; cosmopolitan Nydri, stunning Syvota and the  Vassiliki on the East. Some of them on the leeward side, others sandy, some marked with high white cliffs and deep turquoise waters.</p>
        <h3>Milos</h3>
        <img class="class-img-top" src="milos.jpg" alt="milos" width="50%" height="50%">
        <p>Milos or Melos is a volcanic Greek island in the Aegean Sea. The volcanic activity in ancient years has endowed Milos island with an exciting variety of gorgeous landscapes, consequently offering the visitor a wide range of activities.

        <h3>Zakynthos</h3>
        <img class="class-img-top" src="zakynthos.jpg" alt="zakynthos" width="50%" height="50%">
        <p>Zakynthos is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea. Zakynthos is a top greek destination where thousands of visitors travel to every year. The island’ s protagonist, Navagio, an undoubtedly postcard perfect beach of the Ionian Sea, and one of the most famous and most photographed beaches in Europe.
