        <p>Welcome to my HTML page !</p>
        <p>My name is Maria Elenidou. I hold a Bachelor's degree in English Language and Linguistics from the University of Sheffield and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Multilingual Communication Technology at the University of Geneva. I have previously worked as a volunteer translator and English teacher, and am currently doing my translation internship and  I am volunteer content creator for an organisation. Having Greek as my mother tongue, speaking French and English fluently, German at a professional level and Russian at an intermediate level, I had the opportunity to expose myself to different cultures. I am mainly interested in technology, multilingual communication and localisation. On my website you can find my favourite Greek islands and a brief description. My website is available in English, French, German and Greek.</p>
